# Build neural network with MNIST database
This repository contains code for the construction of basic neural networks from scratch. Dataset used is the MNIST digits database.

1st network: ~95% success rate.

To view the results, run test.py in shell. The file is located at /my_implementation.

Referenced ["Neural Networks and Deep Learning"](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com).
Implementations of some parts may be different from author's to ensure:
a) Further optimization
b) Additional features
c) Compatiblity with Python3
d) My own learning!
